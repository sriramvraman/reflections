How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Diff helps in comparing two files and identifies all the lines that are different in the two files. 
	
	On Windows, we use the tool FC (file compare), with the following code:
		FC old_file.txt new_file.txt
		
	On Mac or Linux or Windows Bash, we use the diff tool, with the following code:
		diff -u old_file.txt new_file.txt

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Makes it easy to switch between versions of code. Especially if some new changes causes a bug, reverting to an older version, or identifying which version worked is extremely helpful. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I personally tend to forget saving - so an auto save would be great. But then an auto-saved version may not work properly if it has some unfinished code.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Google doc files are unlikely to impact other google doc files. But Git is mostly used for programming, where changes in one file can affect other files. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log shows the history of commits along with date when it was changed and the description of the change while committing.
    git diff compares the files across commits and shows the difference between two versions of the same file, line by line. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Great confidence to explore more and make fundamental changes to the code without worrying about whether it would break something that was done earlier. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Go from part-time development to a full-time development mode!
