What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	An ordinary folder becomes a git repository when you initialize it as a repository. Git creates a .git folder which contains metadeta that specify the various versions of the files in repository. 

	But, just initializing a repository is not enough - you need to add files and make a commit for git to start versioning the files. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area is an intermediate area between the working directory and the git repository. You can load selected files from the working directory and then commit them to the repository. 

	This helps in choosing to commit only the files that you want to commit and leaving out the rest.
